  "description": "UKX Wallet is a multi-page, data-driven marketing and dashboard experience for a fictional crypto investing platform. The site is completely static (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) but simulates live behavior through JSON data files, CoinGecko market requests, and an AI assistant backed by the Perplexity API. The project ships with reusable components, custom canvas-based charts, news/article generation tooling, and multiple product surfaces (dashboard, buy/sell flows, calculator, simulator, admin panel, etc.).",
